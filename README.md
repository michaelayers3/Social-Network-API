 # Social Network API


    
 ## Description
 This repo contains code for a mock social media API. The code is written in JavaScript and uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store data. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions. The API also allows users to add and remove friends from their friend list. The API is tested using Insomnia Core.
